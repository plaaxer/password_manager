# Password Manager

- A completely functional and secure password manager made using python and postgresql. 

- **Features:** encryption and decryption with randomly generated salt through a master-password, quick retrieval of data from database, terminal-based application with multiple commands. More detail on cryptography below.

## Setup

**Docker Installation:** To run this app, you need docker installed in your computer. It eases setup as there is no other requirement and you can run this in any OS (as long as it supports Docker). To install it in Debian distros, run: 

- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install docker.io

Check installation by either doing:

- docker --version

Or running the default container hello-world:

- docker run hello-world

**Running:** First, be sure that you are located at /password_manager. Then, run:

- docker build -t password_manager .

You can change the name password_manager to whatever you like. When it finishes building, run the app doing:

- docker run -it password_manager

**ATTENTION:** Do not remove or delete the running container without the backup of data, as it will be lost. It is not recommended to change the config.yaml file, but if you do, you'll have to rebuild the image for it to take effect (database data is not mantained.)

## Encryption

- The stored passwords and usernames are encrypted utilizing symmetric-key encryption and authentication based on the chosen master-password. That means that the master-password must, naturally, be kept safe from third parties, otherwise data could be stolen, but it also means that it is virtually impossible to retrieve data without it.

- The specific tool for encryption and decryption utilized in the password manager is Fernet, a tool for symmetric encryption available on pythonâ€™s Cryptography module, developed by Python Cryptographic Authority (PYCA).

- To generate a Fernet object, however, it is needed a URL-safe base64-encoded 32-byte key, meaning that most (if not all) master-passwords are unfit for being a key directly. To solve that, we first run the master-password through a key-derivation function (KDF), in this case, PBKDF2HMAC, also available on the Cryptography module.

- The PBKDF2HMAC algorithm receives as parameters a SHA256 hashing function, number of iterations and length, but most importantly a randomly (pseudo) generated salt. This salt is extremely important as it will be unique for each added password on the database - meaning that if you have the same password on multiple websites (not advisable), to an attacker all encrypted data will differ even though the passwords are the same. It also makes it so that the database is significantly stronger against rainbow table attacks.

- The salt is then appended to the encrypted data, which is then stored in the database. When retrieving it, the master_password is used to generate the same Fernet object; this time, however, with the salt that is extracted from the last bytes. Having the salt exposed is naturally not a problem, as one can only generate the Fernet object with the correct master-password.

# Usage

- The password manager works using stashes; consider them collections of passwords. Most users won't need more than one, but if you do, it's a working feature. Each stash has its own unique master password, used to encrypt and decrypt data, and refers to a single schema each in the PostgreSQL database (present in the same container). As always, -h flag gives helpful tips and useful commands.

- To register a master password (create a stash):

--register/-r [stash_name] --> stash_name defaults to the config.yaml default_stash variable. It will prompt you for the master password you want to register.

- To enter a stash, you have multiple options:

--enter/-e [stash_name] [master_password]

--enter/-e [master_password] --> stash_name defaults to the config.yaml default_stash variable.

--enter/-e [stash_name] -gs--> -gs flag makes it so that the only argument is the stash_name. It will prompt for master_password.

--enter/-e --> stash_name defaults to config.yaml one and master_password is prompted.

[master_password] --> you can omit --enter/-e
[stash_name] --> same here

- To add a password (you have entered a stash):

--add/-a [service] [user] [password] --> user and password are encrypted, service is not

- To get a password:

--get/-g [service]

- **EXAMPLE**: Suppose you will only use the default stash and want to add user linux@gmail.com with password 123 for service OpenSource, and then retrieve said passowrd and user. You do:

Enter command: -r
Enter master key: secret_masterpassword
Confirm master key: secret_masterpassoword

Enter command: -e secret_masterpassword
Enter command: -a OpenSource linux@gmail.com 123
Enter command: -g OpenSource
